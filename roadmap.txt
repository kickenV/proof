ChefsPlan 5.0 – Development Roadmap &
Checklist
Below is a structured development roadmap for ChefsPlan 5.0, a decentralized gig-work platform
connecting chefs and restaurants. The roadmap is organized by key milestones/phases, and each
section includes checklists of development tasks, team roles involved, and prerequisites or
dependencies for that stage. This plan is based on the system architecture and phased approach
described in the project’s whitepaper and scaffold overview.

MVP Delivery – Core Platform Foundation (Phase 1)
In Phase 1 (MVP), the focus is on implementing the core platform functionality and proving the concept
in a real setting. This includes deploying essential smart contracts on the zkSync Layer-2 network for
shift postings, applications, acceptances, and escrowed payments, along with a basic user-facing dApp
and minimal off-chain automation 1 . Off-chain agents (e.g. Matching and Payout) run in a
rudimentary form to automate notifications and payouts 2 . To expedite delivery, some features
remain simplified at this stage – for example, compliance/KYC checks might be handled manually by an
admin, and the reputation system can start as a simple off-chain rating stored in a database and
periodically anchored on-chain 3 . By the end of Phase 1, ChefsPlan should be a working decentralized
marketplace on zkSync with real escrowed funds, albeit with certain trust assumptions and basic
features for a pilot user group.
Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Implement core smart contracts – Develop and unit-test the ShiftManager, Escrow, and
Reputation contracts (using Solidity) to handle shift lifecycle, payment escrow, and reputation tracking
4 . Follow upgradeable proxy patterns for future flexibility.
- [ ] Deploy contracts on zkSync testnet – Use Hardhat (with zkSync plugins) to compile and deploy the
contracts to a zkSync Era test network for initial testing. Verify basic operations like posting a shift,
applying, and releasing escrow.
- [ ] Build the basic dApp (web frontend) – Create a simple Next.js web application for chefs and
restaurants. Implement pages for browsing available shifts, posting a new shift, viewing applications,
and managing agreements. Integrate a Web3 wallet (e.g. MetaMask) for user authentication and
transaction signing on zkSync.
- [ ] Integrate wallet & accounts – Ensure the dApp connects to zkSync (L2) via web3 providers. Enable
wallet connection and switching to zkSync network in the UI (use zkSync’s Web3Provider to wrap
MetaMask for L2 transactions 5 6 ).
- [ ] Implement off-chain agents – Develop basic versions of the Matching Agent and Payout Agent
as off-chain processes (Node.js or Python) that listen to contract events and perform automation 7 .
For MVP, the Matching agent can simply log or notify when a new shift is posted (no complex AI
matching yet), and the Payout agent can automatically release funds or send reminders when a shift is
completed.
- [ ] Basic testing & pilot run – Conduct end-to-end testing of the MVP: simulate a restaurant posting a
shift, a chef applying, acceptance of the application, and escrow payout upon completion. Fix any critical
bugs. Prepare a small pilot with real users (e.g. a few restaurants/chefs) to gather feedback on the core
workflow.

Team Roles Involved:
- Blockchain Smart Contract Developer – Implements and tests the Solidity contracts (ShiftManager,
Escrow, Reputation) and ensures they follow security best practices.
- Front-End (Web3) Developer – Builds the Next.js dApp, integrates wallet connectivity, and ensures a
smooth UX for posting shifts and managing applications.
- Off-Chain Agent Developer – Programs the initial automation agents (Matching, Payout) and sets up
event listeners using ethers/zkSync provider. May be the same person as backend/blockchain dev in a
small team.
- Project Lead/Architect – Coordinates the integration of smart contracts, backend, and frontend
components; defines the overall module interfaces according to the whitepaper architecture.
- QA/Test Engineer – Creates test scenarios for the end-to-end flow (including edge cases like disputes)
and verifies that escrow and application processes work on zkSync as expected.
Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- Development Tooling: Hardhat configured with zkSync plugins (e.g.

@matterlabs/hardhat-

zksync-solc and deploy plugins) for zkEVM-compatible compilation and deployment

8

. Node.js

environment with project dependencies (Solidity compiler, OpenZeppelin upgradeable libraries, etc.)
installed.
- zkSync Network Access: Access to a zkSync Era testnet endpoint (e.g. an RPC URL) with the
appropriate network config (including an L1 link for bridging, and zksync: true flag in Hardhat
config) 9 . Testnet ETH (on zkSync) in developer wallets for paying transaction fees.
- Web3 Wallets: MetaMask or similar wallet set up with the zkSync testnet chain (chain ID, RPC URL) for
local testing of the dApp. Ensure team members have test accounts (chef and restaurant roles) with
keys configured in the dApp for simulation.
- IPFS/Storage Setup: (For MVP, if including off-chain storage) Access to an IPFS node or pinning service
to store shift descriptions and any uploaded files. This can be an Infura or Pinata account for
convenience during development.
- Contracts and Libraries: OpenZeppelin upgradeable contracts library installed for proxy patterns;
ensure contract addresses (once deployed) are recorded for the frontend and agents.
- Environment Variables: Securely store sensitive keys (private key for deployments, Infura API keys,
etc.) in a .env file or the CI/CD pipeline for deployment. Configure the frontend with the correct contract
addresses and network IDs.

zkSync Compatibility & Deployment Pipeline (Phase 1)
ChefsPlan 5.0 is built on zkSync Era, so establishing compatibility and a robust deployment pipeline is
critical from the start. This involves tailoring the development and DevOps process to zkSync’s
environment. The smart contracts must be compiled with zkSync’s VM in mind, and deployment scripts
should target the zkSync testnet (and later mainnet) network configurations 10 . The pipeline will also
handle migrating from testnet to mainnet, including any bridging of ETH for gas and verifying contract
deployments. By setting up continuous integration early, the team can deploy updates quickly and
ensure the MVP is consistently synced with zkSync’s latest tooling.
Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Configure zkSync toolchain – Update Hardhat configuration for zkSync Era compatibility. This
includes using Matter Labs’ zkSync compiler plugin and enabling the zksync flag in network configs
10 . Install the zkSync upgradable plugin to deploy proxy contracts on zkSync (supports Transparent

and UUPS proxies) 11 .
- [ ] Write deployment scripts – Create automated scripts (e.g. scripts/deploy.js ) to deploy the
ShiftManager, Escrow, and Reputation contracts to the zkSync testnet 12 . The script should handle

2

deploying logic contracts and initializing proxy contracts correctly. Include logic to output or save the
deployed addresses for use in the frontend and agents.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup – Set up a continuous integration pipeline (using GitHub Actions or similar) to
run tests and deploy contracts to testnet on new releases. This should pull secrets (private keys, RPC
URLs) from a secure store and execute the Hardhat deployment. Include a review step before promoting
deployments to the zkSync mainnet.
- [ ] zkSync testnet testing – Deploy the MVP contracts to a public zkSync testnet environment and run
integration tests. Ensure that contract interactions (transactions) are finalizing and that the L2 behaves
as expected. Test edge cases like re-orgs or bridging if relevant (zkSync being an L2 requires considering
L1 finality for certain operations).
- [ ] Deployment on mainnet – Once the MVP is stable on testnet, prepare for zkSync mainnet
deployment. This involves bridging the required ETH to zkSync for gas fees, updating configurations to
the mainnet RPC, and double-checking all addresses and initial parameters (like proxy admin address).
Plan a mainnet deployment window and a rollback strategy if issues occur.
- [ ] Contract verification & monitoring – Verify the deployed contracts on the zkSync block explorer (if
available) or publish the ABI/source for transparency. Set up monitoring for the contracts (e.g. listen to
critical events or use a service to track contract errors) so the team is alerted to any on-chain issues
post-deployment.
Team Roles Involved:
- DevOps Engineer – Designs and maintains the CI/CD pipeline for deploying contracts and the
application. Ensures secure handling of keys and smooth promotion from testnet to mainnet.
- Blockchain Developer – Configures the Hardhat environment for zkSync, writes the deployment and
migration scripts, and handles network-specific issues (like gas token differences on zkSync). Also
responsible for verifying that contracts behave identically on zkSync as they would on Ethereum.
- QA Engineer – Focuses on deployment testing, ensuring that after deployment on testnet, the system
works end-to-end. They might create automated test suites that run on a local zkSync node or testnet to
validate each deployment.
- Project Manager – Schedules and coordinates the go-live on mainnet, ensuring that prerequisites (like
funding the deployer account with ETH on L2) are done and that all stakeholders sign off on the
deployment.
Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- zkSync SDKs and Plugins: The development environment must include Matter Labs’ Hardhat plugins
for zkSync (for compilation and deployment) and any necessary zkSync libraries (e.g. zksync-web3 for
interacting with contracts). Confirm compatibility of Solidity version and features with zkSync’s compiler.
Network
Configuration:
Access
to
zkSync
Era
Testnet
RPC
(e.g.
https://
testnet.era.zksync.dev ) and a corresponding Ethereum testnet (Goerli/Sepolia) RPC for L1
bridging context 9 . These should be configured in Hardhat and environment files. For mainnet, obtain
the zkSync mainnet RPC and ensure the team has L1 mainnet access if needed for bridging.
- Private Keys and Accounts: A deployment Ethereum account (EOA) with its private key configured for
Hardhat, funded on the zkSync testnet (and later mainnet) with enough ETH to cover gas. Typically, this
means having some ETH on L1 and then depositing to zkSync. Acquire testnet ETH from faucets and
ensure the deployer address is funded on L2.
- Continuous Integration Tools: Set up GitHub repository secrets for the private key and RPC URLs.
Ensure the CI runner has Node.js and can install the zkSync-specific packages. Verify that the pipeline
can fail safely (e.g., halts deployment if tests fail).
- Proxy/Upgrade Infrastructure: The OpenZeppelin Upgrades library (via the zkSync Hardhat plugin)
must be configured. Determine proxy admin ownership (the address that will own the proxies and can
upgrade logic contracts). This might initially be a dev multisig or an EOA; note that later in governance
phase this might transfer to the DAO.

3

- Documentation: Document the deployment steps and configurations. This includes a runbook for
deploying to new networks (for example, instructions to deploy to another L2 or how to initialize a new
proxy admin) so that the process is repeatable and team members can assist or take over if needed.

Compliance Agent Integration (Simulated Verification, Phase 1)
As part of the MVP, ChefsPlan introduces a Compliance Agent to handle participant requirements (e.g.
work eligibility, certifications) in a simulated manner. At this early stage, the compliance checks are not
fully decentralized or automated via zero-knowledge proofs – instead, the system uses a placeholder/
off-chain process to verify that chefs meet certain criteria. The Compliance Agent runs off-chain,
listening for events (such as a chef applying to a shift) and then referencing an external record or admin
input to decide if the chef is “verified” or not 13 . In practice, this could mean the agent checks a JSON
file or database of pre-verified users, and logs a warning or updates a flag if an unverified chef tries to
take a gig 14 . This simulation lays the groundwork for Phase 2, where real KYC/credential verification
will be done via zero-knowledge proofs – for now, it ensures the compliance logic is in place without
blocking the MVP launch.
Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Develop Compliance Agent script – Create an off-chain service (Node.js script or Python daemon)
called Compliance Agent that connects to the zkSync network (using a Web3 provider) and subscribes
to relevant events (e.g. ShiftManager.ShiftApplied when a chef applies for a shift) 13 .
Implement callback logic that triggers on these events.
- [ ] Simulate credential checks – Within the agent, implement a placeholder check for chef credentials.
This could be a function like checkChefCredentials(chefAddress) that looks up the chef’s status
in an off-chain data source 15 . For MVP, this might simply reference a hardcoded list or a JSON file of
“verified chefs” (simulating that those chefs have provided required documents offline).
- [ ] Handle verification outcomes – Define the agent’s actions based on the check above. If a chef is
not verified for a certain requirement, the agent might log a warning or call a specific smart contract
function to record this. For example, it could call ShiftManager.markChefUnverified(shiftId,
chefAddr) or a similar function (if implemented) to mark that the application needs attention 16 . If
the chef is verified, the agent can log approval or take no action, allowing the process to continue
normally.
- [ ] Integrate with on-chain data (if applicable) – If the smart contracts include any compliancerelated hooks (e.g. a field in ShiftManager or a separate ComplianceRegistry contract that can store
verification flags), integrate the agent to update those. In MVP, this might be minimal or even skipped
(the agent could operate purely off-chain), but the scaffolding should allow later plugging in actual onchain verification.
- [ ] Testing the compliance flow – Simulate scenarios to ensure the Compliance Agent behaves
correctly. For example, attempt a shift application with a “verified” chef vs an “unverified” chef in the offchain list and observe that the agent logs or flags the latter. Ensure that these conditions appropriately
inform the team or the application (for instance, the restaurant might see an admin warning that a
chef’s credentials are pending verification).
- [ ] Prepare for future integration – Although the verification is simulated, design the agent’s
structure to be extensible. Cleanly separate the verification check (which is a stub now) so that in
Phase 2 it can be replaced with calls to a real ZK verification system. Possibly include configuration for
different credential types (ID, work permit, certifications) even if the logic just returns “true” for all in
MVP. This foresight will ease the Phase 2 upgrade.
Team Roles Involved:
- Backend/Agent Developer – Implements the Compliance Agent service. Needs familiarity with web3

4

libraries and event listeners to interact with the zkSync network. Also simulates the business logic for
verification criteria.
- Smart Contract Developer – (If needed) updates or writes any smart contract hooks for compliance (e.g.,
functions or events in ShiftManager related to verification status). In MVP this role is minor, but they
ensure the contracts emit the events the agent listens to, and later will modify contracts to require
proofs.
- DevOps Engineer – Sets up the runtime environment for the Compliance Agent. This could involve a
server or cloud function to run the agent continuously, and ensuring it can securely connect to the
blockchain (RPC endpoint, keys if needed). Also handles logging or alerting if the agent flags an issue
(so the team can intervene in a pilot).
- Compliance Analyst (advisor role) – Though not heavily involved in coding at MVP stage, a domain expert
can define what “being verified” means in context (e.g., which certifications are required for chefs). They
provide the criteria that the simulated logic will check, ensuring the simulation aligns with real
compliance needs.
Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- Event Interface from Contracts: The ShiftManager (or related) contract must emit events on key
actions (e.g., a chef applying to a shift) that the Compliance Agent can subscribe to. According to the
scaffold, events like ShiftApplied are available for this purpose 17 . Ensure the ABI and contract
address are available to the agent.
- Off-Chain Verification Data: Prepare a data source to simulate verification. This could be as simple as
a JSON file (mapping chef addresses to a boolean “verified” status) stored locally or on IPFS, or a small
database of test users. The agent should know how to access this (for instance, load the JSON at
startup, or fetch from an IPFS CID if simulating a decentralized storage of credentials).
- Node Access & Credentials: The agent needs access to a zkSync RPC endpoint (WebSocket or HTTP
with polling) to listen for events. If using a WebSocket, ensure the provider supports subscriptions (e.g.,
an Alchemy/Infura ws endpoint for zkSync if available) 18 . If the agent will make transactions (e.g.,
calling a contract function to mark unverified), it needs a private key and account with enough zkSync
ETH to send that transaction – set up an agent Ethereum account if needed for these calls.
- Runtime Environment: Decide where the Compliance Agent will run during development and MVP
deployment. Options include running locally (manual launch when testing) or deploying it on a server/
VM. For MVP/pilot, a simple approach is running it as a background process by the dev team. In
production, it might be containerized and deployed. Ensure Node.js (if using Node) is installed in that
environment and necessary packages (ethers, etc.) are available.
- Logging & Monitoring: Set up a way to observe the Compliance Agent’s activity. During dev, console
logs are sufficient. For a pilot, integrate a logger that writes to a file or dashboard. This will help in
debugging if, for example, an application was blocked due to verification – the team can see the agent’s
logs to know why.

IPFS-Based Data Handling (Shift Details & Credentials, Phase 1)
To maintain decentralization and reduce on-chain storage, ChefsPlan uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File
System) for data that is too large or sensitive to store on Ethereum. In the MVP, this means details like
shift descriptions, chef profiles, or attached documents are stored off-chain in IPFS, and only their
content hashes (CIDs) are referenced in smart contracts 19 . By doing so, the system keeps on-chain
transactions lightweight while still ensuring data integrity (since the IPFS hash is tamper-evident). The
ShiftManager contract, for instance, will record an IPFS CID for each shift’s full description rather than
the raw text 20 . Likewise, any credentials or agreements can be placed on IPFS and fetched by users or
agents when needed. This phase involves setting up the IPFS integration and ensuring the dApp and
agents can smoothly read/write to distributed storage.

5

Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Set up IPFS node or service – Decide on the IPFS backend for the project. For development, this
could be running a local IPFS node or using a third-party IPFS pinning service (like Pinata or Infura’s IPFS
API). Configure the project with the API endpoint and credentials if using a service. Make sure the IPFS
node is accessible by the frontend (possibly via a gateway URL) for retrieving files.
- [ ] Implement file upload & pinning – In the dApp, implement logic for uploading data to IPFS. For
example, when a restaurant posts a new shift, the form details (title, description, requirements, etc.)
should be bundled into a JSON object or similar format. Upon submission, the frontend (or a cloud
function) uploads this JSON to IPFS and obtains the content hash (CID). Ensure that the uploaded data is
pinned so that it persists on IPFS (if using a pinning service, through their API).
- [ ] Store content hashes on-chain – Modify the ShiftManager contract’s postShift function to
accept an IPFS content hash (CID) for the shift details 20 . The contract will store this string (or a
Keccak-256 digest of it if needed) as part of the Shift record. The escrow or matching processes then
only deal with this reference. This task may involve choosing the data type for the CID (e.g., a string
or bytes in Solidity) and ensuring it can handle the IPFS hash length.
- [ ] Retrieve IPFS data in the dApp – When displaying shift details in the frontend (e.g., chef browsing
shifts), implement a fetch from IPFS. Using the stored CID from the contract, the frontend can query via
an IPFS gateway or client library to get the JSON and then render the full description. Handle the case
where data might not load (e.g. if IPFS is slow) by providing loading states or caching frequently
accessed content.
- [ ] Store user credentials/docs – If the MVP involves any user-uploaded documents (like a chef’s
certification or an agreement PDF), integrate those with IPFS as well. For instance, a chef’s profile might
have a field for a “credential file CID” that points to an uploaded certificate image or PDF on IPFS.
Although full ZK verification isn’t live yet, storing these off-chain sets the stage for later proving
knowledge of them. Update the Compliance Agent to know where to find a chef’s credential file (e.g.,
perhaps the agent can read a CID from the chef’s profile in the contract or a central list, then fetch that
file from IPFS during verification checks).
- [ ] Ensure data privacy where needed – Consider if any data needs to be encrypted before going
onto IPFS. Public shift details can likely be plain JSON, but personal documents might be sensitive. At
MVP stage, it could be acceptable to store them unencrypted but access-controlled by only sharing CIDs
with authorized parties. However, note in design that later phases might introduce encryption or ZK
proofs, so structure the data storage with that future upgrade in mind (e.g., keep personal data
separate so it could be replaced by a proof).
Team Roles Involved:
- Full-Stack Developer – Handles integration of IPFS on both frontend and backend. On the frontend,
implements upload and retrieval logic (possibly using ipfs-http-client or an API); on the backend/
DevOps side, sets up the IPFS node or configures the third-party service.
- Smart Contract Developer – Updates smart contracts to include IPFS hash references. Ensures that
storing the hash is efficient (maybe using content identifiers directly) and that events or return values
expose those hashes for the frontend/agents to consume. Also responsible for any hashing scheme if
needed (for example, if storing a digest vs full CID).
- DevOps Engineer – If self-hosting IPFS, maintains the IPFS node. Ensures it’s pinned to the required data
and is reachable. If using a service, they manage API keys and monitor pinning status. Also sets up
backup strategies (IPFS is decentralized but pinning ensures availability – the team might want multiple
pins or a cluster for important data).
- Security/Privacy Expert (consulting role) – Advises on what data can safely be public on IPFS vs. what
might need encryption or access control. At MVP, this might be minimal involvement, but decisions here
affect user privacy, so having guidelines (like “okay to store shift descriptions publicly, but personal IDs
should be encrypted or redacted”) is useful.

6

Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- IPFS Access: An operational IPFS node or account with a pinning service. For local testing, running
go-ipfs daemon or using the JS IPFS can work. For a persistent environment, get API credentials for
a service like Pinata. Also, a chosen method for the frontend to fetch data (e.g., using a public gateway
like ipfs.io or a dedicated gateway URL provided by the pinning service).
- Data Format Definition: Define how shift details and other data will be structured off-chain. For
example, a JSON schema for a “Shift” object (with fields like title, description, location, etc.), and maybe
another for “Profile” or credentials. Standardize this so that both producers (the form that uploads) and
consumers (the UI that downloads and shows it) agree on format.
- Content Identifier Handling: Ensure the system can handle IPFS CIDs correctly. If using CIDv1
(base58 or base32 strings), confirm the smart contract storage and events are accommodating those
(string length ~46 characters for base58). If needed, decide on storing a multihash vs the entire URI.
Also include support in the web app to convert or properly display truncated versions if needed.
- Bandwidth and Caching: Accessing IPFS can introduce latency. For a smoother UX, set up caching for
frequently accessed data. This could be done at the application layer (storing fetched JSON in memory
or localStorage) or using a service that caches gateway responses. Ensure the development
environment has sufficient bandwidth to fetch IPFS content, and consider using a closer gateway for
performance.
- Fallback Plan: In case IPFS is temporarily unreachable, decide what happens – e.g., the dApp could
show “Content temporarily unavailable, please retry.” For MVP, having a single source is acceptable, but
document these cases as things to improve (like multi-gateway queries or having the data also on a
backup server for emergency).

Zero-Knowledge Credential Verification & Selective Disclosure
(Phase 2)
In Phase 2, ChefsPlan enhances privacy and trust by integrating zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for
user credentials and introducing selective disclosure techniques. The goal is to allow chefs and
restaurants to prove they meet certain requirements (identity, certifications, etc.) without revealing
sensitive personal data. This phase likely involves partnering with a decentralized identity solution or
framework (e.g. integrating with Polygon ID, Sismo, or similar ZK identity providers) to issue verifiable
credentials 21 . Users will obtain ZK-based credentials (for example, a proof of having a work permit or
food safety certification) and present proofs to the platform. The smart contracts and/or the
Compliance Agent are updated to verify these proofs on-chain, or to accept attestations from trusted ZK
attesters, instead of relying on manual or off-chain checks 22 . Additionally, the platform can implement
selective disclosure: users could prove statements like “I am certified to level X” or “I have a rating above
4 stars” without exposing all underlying data 23 . By the end of Phase 2, all participants would be
cryptographically verified, eliminating the need for ChefsPlan (or any central admin) to store personal
info, thus greatly improving privacy and compliance adherence.
Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Integrate a ZK identity solution – Research and choose a ZK credential system (e.g., Polygon ID,
Sismo, or custom circom circuits). Implement the integration such that chefs and restaurants can obtain
verifiable credentials. For instance, a chef might use a mobile app or web interface to generate a proof
of identity/qualification issued by a trusted issuer. ChefsPlan’s platform needs to accept these proofs.
This could mean deploying a verifier smart contract (if using custom proofs) or using an existing
protocol’s verifier. Update the Compliance Agent and smart contracts to require a valid proof for certain
actions (e.g., applying to a shift might now require a ZK proof of certification).
- [ ] Design ZK circuits or use templates – If a custom approach is required, design zk-SNARK circuits
that encode the verification logic (e.g., “user’s government ID is valid and indicates they are over 18”).

7

Alternatively, use template circuits from an identity platform. Ensure circuits are efficient (proving time
is reasonable) and secure. If using something like Polygon ID, configure the appropriate credential
schema (e.g., a credential that says “Chef is registered with Dutch Chamber of Commerce” or “Chef has
completed food safety training Level 2”) and how it will be verified.
- [ ] Update smart contracts for verification – Modify or add smart contract methods to handle onchain proof verification. For example, a new verifyCredential(bytes proof, bytes32
merkleRoot) function that can be called to validate a proof against a known verifier contract or a
state root. The Compliance Agent could invoke this on-chain verification when a new user registers or
applies to a shift. If using an attestation approach, the contract might accept a signed attestation from a
trusted issuer instead (which could be simpler but semi-centralized). In either case, the contract system
must record that a given user is verified without exposing why (no personal data on-chain, just a flag or
credential hash).
- [ ] Implement selective disclosure for reputation – Extend the reputation system to utilize ZK proofs
for privacy. For instance, allow a chef to prove qualitatively that their average rating is above a certain
threshold without revealing the exact number. This could involve issuing a ZK credential for reputation
(e.g., the platform or a oracle-like agent could issue a credential “Reputation > 4.0” to a chef, which the
chef can then prove). Alternatively, design the Reputation contract to support zero-knowledge queries
(this is complex and might use cryptographic accumulators or range proofs). As a first step, focus on
one or two practical selective disclosures (like rating threshold or number of completed shifts) and
implement a prototype proof for those. 23
- [ ] Migrate data to decentralized storage – If any personal data was temporarily kept in a centralized
database during MVP (for example, copies of IDs or certificates), Phase 2 is the time to remove that.
Replace those with either IPFS-stored encrypted files plus ZK proofs of their contents, or with purely onchain verifiable credentials. Essentially, ensure the platform no longer requires storing raw personal
info on its servers 24 . This task includes writing migration scripts or procedures for existing user data:
e.g., reach out to pilot users to provide new ZK credentials or re-verify through the new system.
- [ ] Security audits and testing – Introduce comprehensive testing for all new ZK features. This means
unit tests for the proof verification logic (if custom circuits, include tests with valid/invalid proofs),
integration tests where a user goes through the whole flow (obtaining credential, submitting a proof to
smart contract, doing an action like applying to a shift successfully). Engage an external auditor to
review the smart contracts, especially the new verification logic and any new contracts deployed for ZK
credentials 25 . Also audit the zero-knowledge circuits themselves if custom – ensure there are no
vulnerabilities (zero-knowledge code should be checked for soundness, no trivial bypass, etc.). Deploy
the updated system to a testnet environment (could be zkSync testnet or even a local zk-EVM if easier)
and conduct a testnet beta with a larger user group to get feedback on the ZK onboarding flow.
Team Roles Involved:
- Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Engineer – Specializes in zk-SNARK/STARK technologies. This person designs or
integrates the credential verification circuits and ensures the proofs are correctly verified on-chain. They
might write circuits in Circom, ZoKrates, or use off-the-shelf solutions from an identity protocol.
- Smart Contract Developer – Modifies the Ethereum contracts to include verification logic, possibly
deploys new contracts (like a Verifier contract or an Identity registry). Works closely with the ZK
engineer to make sure the on-chain and off-chain parts connect (public inputs match, etc.). Also
upgrades the Reputation contract if needed for on-chain reputation handling with privacy.
- Frontend/UX Developer – Updates the user interface to incorporate the new verification steps. For
example, adding a verification flow where a user connects an identity wallet or scans a QR code to
generate a proof. Ensures the process is user-friendly (ZK can be complex, so abstract it with clear
prompts like “Click here to verify your credentials”). Possibly integrates with wallet plugins or SDKs
provided by identity solutions (e.g., an SDK to request a Polygon ID proof from the user).
- DevOps/Backend – If the ZK solution requires backend components (like an issuance server or a
database for credentials), the DevOps or backend engineer sets those up. For instance, some systems

8

require running a service that issues credentials to verified users – the team might run an issuer node
that grants a credential after manually checking someone’s ID (in early phases). Also responsible for
ensuring the proving key and verification key (if applicable) are managed securely and deployed
correctly.
- Compliance Officer / Legal Advisor – Although much is technical, having a compliance expert is
important. They ensure that whatever KYC/credential is being proven actually satisfies legal
requirements (e.g., if Dutch law requires checking a chef’s ID, the advisor confirms that using a ZK proof
of ID is acceptable). They might also help select which identity platform has credibility (or help establish
ChefsPlan as an issuer of work credentials).
- Security Auditor (external) – Not a daily team role, but at this phase the project engages security
auditors to evaluate the new cryptographic implementations. They will look at smart contracts and
possibly the ZK circuits or the integration with identity providers.
Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- ZK Infrastructure: Acquire or set up the necessary infrastructure for zero-knowledge proofs. If using a
known solution like Polygon ID, get API keys or set up an issuer organization within that system. If
building custom, generate proving and verifying keys for the circuits (which can be time-consuming if
circuits are large – plan for the ceremony or key generation step). Ensure the team has access to
libraries (e.g., snarkJS, circom runtime, or identity SDKs) needed to generate and verify proofs.
- Trusted Issuers: Identify who or what will issue the initial credentials. For example, if verifying
identities, perhaps integrate with an existing KYC provider that can issue a ZK attestation that “passport
verified” for a user. If it’s going to be done in-house initially (for pilot, the team might act as the issuer of
“verified chef” credentials), set up a secure process for that. This might involve a simple web form where
an admin checks a document and then triggers issuing a credential to the user’s wallet.
- User Wallet Compatibility: Ensure that user wallets can handle the ZK credentials. Some solutions
have their own apps (e.g., a separate mobile app for holding credentials). Plan how chefs and
restaurants will store and present credentials – for instance, they might need to install a specific wallet
or app. Provide instructions or integrate support into the ChefsPlan dApp (maybe via WalletConnect if a
mobile app is used).
- Performance Considerations: Be aware of the performance impacts – generating a proof on a mobile
device can be intensive. Choose ZK algorithms that are mobile-friendly (or allow server-side proving if
that doesn’t compromise trust too much). Also ensure the on-chain verification doesn’t use excessive
gas; zkSync might have cheaper costs, but verifying a proof still has a cost. Optimize circuits to keep
proof verification within reasonable gas limits or use recursion if needed to combine multiple proofs
efficiently.
- Regulatory Check: Before fully rolling out, do a check that using ZK proofs meets compliance
requirements. For example, if audited, can the platform demonstrate compliance? (Perhaps by showing
the list of attestation issuers and the fact that all users have valid attestations, without revealing user
identities.) Having a strategy to reassure regulators (maybe maintaining an off-chain log of verifications
done, signed by an issuer) could be a prerequisite in highly regulated contexts.
- Migration Plan: A plan to transition existing users to the new system. If Phase 1 had 100 users who
were manually KYCed, Phase 2 might require them to re-verify via the new method. Prepare
communications and possibly incentives (like “verify your profile with our new privacy-preserving
system and earn a badge or token reward”) to encourage smooth adoption.

Reputation System Enhancements (Phase 2+)
The Reputation system introduced in the MVP (basic star ratings) will be significantly enhanced in
Phase 2 and beyond. The aim is to make reputation more robust, fair, and privacy-preserving. In earlier
stages, the reputation may have been as simple as an average star rating stored off-chain or in a basic
contract. Now, we plan to move it fully on-chain and improve its fidelity. Only authorized actions should

9

affect reputation (e.g., only participants of a completed shift can rate each other, to prevent arbitrary
ratings). We may introduce weighted scoring (for example, a rating from a high-stakes gig might count
more than a small gig) or other advanced logic 26 . Additionally, to align with the privacy goals, we can
integrate zero-knowledge elements: users might prove aspects of their reputation (like being above a
threshold) without revealing exact details, as mentioned in Phase 2 with selective disclosure 27 . By
upgrading the reputation system, ChefsPlan can better incentivize good behavior and provide reliable
signals to users, all while protecting individual data.
Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Upgrade on-chain reputation contract – Refactor the Reputation.sol contract to support more
complex functionality. If it was initially basic (just storing totals and counts 28 ), consider expanding it to
maintain additional metrics: e.g., number of gigs completed by the user, cumulative earnings (to weight
feedback by experience), or separate ratings for different categories (professionalism, skill, etc.).
Implement restrictions so that submitRating can only be called by parties of a completed shift
(perhaps the ShiftManager contract now calls Reputation.sol when a shift is finalized to record mutual
ratings). Introduce an authorization check in the contract (or rely on ShiftManager) to prevent any
invalid inputs 29 . Ensure the contract remains upgradeable for future tweaks.
- [ ] Integrate ZK-proof for reputation (if applicable) – Building on Phase 2’s ZK infrastructure, allow
certain reputation info to be proved in zero-knowledge. For example, after each gig, instead of directly
storing a numeric rating on-chain, the platform could issue a credential to the chef like “Chef X has a 5star review from gig Y” which could later be aggregated off-chain and proved. However, this approach
can be complex; a simpler approach is to keep storing ratings on-chain but use cryptographic
techniques to hide or abstract them when needed. A concrete task could be: Implement a function or
off-chain service for selective disclosure of reputation: e.g., generate a proof that user’s average > 4
without revealing all underlying ratings. This likely involves heavy cryptography (like a ZK circuit that
takes all ratings as inputs); it might be more realistic to plan this for beyond Phase 2, but Phase 2 can
lay the groundwork (like storing data in a way that is ZK-friendly later).
- [ ] Reputation as SBT (Soulbound Token) – Consider minting a Soulbound Token that encapsulates a
user’s reputation. An SBT (a non-transferable NFT) could represent a chef’s reputation score or level. For
instance, levels like Bronze/Silver/Gold chef based on number of successful gigs and average rating.
These tokens can be updated (or reissued) as the reputation changes. The advantage is that it’s easily
shareable across platforms (and could be used in multi-chain scenarios later) and it’s inherently tied to
the user’s identity. Task: design the SBT contract (or use an existing standard), and have the Reputation
system mint/update SBTs when thresholds are reached. This must be done carefully to avoid spam or
frequent updates – maybe only significant changes trigger an update.
- [ ] Front-end and UX improvements – Enhance how reputation is presented to users and how they
can use it. For example, display more detailed profiles: show total gigs completed, badges for top
ratings, etc. Also implement any features for selective disclosure in the UI – e.g., a chef can click “Prove
my rating” to get a sharable proof or to satisfy a requirement for certain high-end shifts that require a
minimum rating. Additionally, add mechanisms to prevent abuse: perhaps integrate a dispute
resolution for unfair ratings (this might tie into the DAO phase later, but start considering it).
- [ ] Backfill and migration – If the reputation system logic changes, plan to migrate or recompute
existing reputation data. For instance, if we move from off-chain to on-chain, import the existing ratings
from the pilot database into the new contract (maybe via a one-time script that the contract owner can
call to set initial values). If introducing SBTs, mint tokens for users based on their current scores. Ensure
no data is lost in transition. Also, communicate to users if there are changes (e.g., “We’ve updated how
ratings are calculated to better reflect experience”).
- [ ] Testing and validation – Test the enhanced reputation flows thoroughly. This includes unit tests for
the new Reputation.sol functions (ensuring only valid callers can rate, etc.), simulation tests for SBT
issuance (if using), and usability testing on the front-end to make sure reputation info is clear and

10

trustworthy. If adding complexity like weighted ratings or category ratings, validate that these actually
improve the system (perhaps by simulating different scenarios or getting user feedback).
Team Roles Involved:
- Blockchain Developer – In charge of modifying the Reputation contract (and possibly deploying a new
version via proxy upgrade). Should have a good sense of designing incentive systems to ensure the
contract changes align with desired behaviors (for example, thinking through how users might try to
game the rating system and mitigating that in code).
- Data Analyst – Helps determine the improved reputation formula or weights. Using data from the pilot,
they might analyze how ratings were used and propose enhancements (like “if we weight by gig value,
the top performers change in this way…”). This role ensures the reputation metric is meaningful and not
easily exploited.
- Frontend Developer – Updates the profile and search UI to incorporate the richer reputation info
(graphs, badges, etc.). Also handles any user interaction with the reputation system (such as viewing
proofs or understanding their rating). They need to make complex concepts (like an SBT or ZK-proof of
rating) understandable to non-technical users.
- ZK/Blockchain Engineer – If implementing ZK aspects or soulbound tokens, this engineer handles those
specialized tasks. They might design how the SBT metadata is structured or how the proof generation
for “reputation > X” would work. Ensures that the integration between reputation data and any
cryptographic proof is solid.
- Community Manager (indirectly) – As reputation is a user-facing feature, the community/outreach
person might gather user feedback on the fairness and utility of the reputation system. They relay if
chefs feel the ratings accurately reflect their work or if restaurants trust the scores, which can inform
further tweaks.
Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- Existing Reputation Data: Have access to the current repository of ratings (from MVP phase). This
might be on-chain in a simple form or stored off-chain. It’s needed for analysis and for migration into
the enhanced system. Make sure this data is backed up and consistent.
- OpenZeppelin or Libraries: If using an SBT approach, leverage standards (ERC-721 with nontransferable extension, or the emerging ERC-5192 for soulbound). Import any libraries or base contracts
needed. If sticking to a pure contract upgrade, ensure the storage layout can accommodate new fields
(for proxy upgrade, new variables for more stats, etc.).
- ZK Proof Tools (optional): If pursuing selective disclosure via ZK, ensure the ZK stack from Phase 2 is
available. This includes any proving key, circuits that might need to incorporate reputation. For example,
if building a circuit “prove average rating ≥ 4”, that circuit needs the user’s ratings as inputs, which
means we need a way to input those privately – possibly requiring an off-chain data pull and user
interaction. The tools to do this (like user running a prover in their browser) should be prototyped.
- Community Governance Input: (Forward-looking dependency) – If planning to eventually allow the
community to shape the rep system (in DAO phase, e.g., adjust how reputation is calculated), consider
documenting the parameters that could be tweaked. This is not an immediate dependency, but
preparing the system with configurable parameters (like weights or thresholds that could be voted on
later) could be wise. For now, decide these parameters internally but keep in mind they might become
governance-controlled.
- Testing Framework: Up-to-date tests from Phase 1 should be extended. Utilize a testing framework
(like Hardhat/Foundry tests) to verify that after an upgrade, existing data remains correct (write tests for
upgrade by initializing a proxy with old data, then upgrading and seeing that data is still accessible and
new functions work). Also, possibly integrate a static analyzer or formal verification tool for the new
reputation logic if it’s critical (ensuring no overflow in calculations, etc., especially if using averages or
division).

11

Scalability & Multi-Agent Optimization (Phase 3)
With core functionality and privacy features in place, Phase 3 shifts focus to scaling up the platform and
optimizing the network of autonomous agents. This involves both technical scalability (handling more
users and transactions) and operational scalability (agents and processes that can manage a high
volume of gigs efficiently). On the blockchain side, ChefsPlan can explore deploying on multiple
networks or an app-specific rollup to reach a broader audience and distribute load 30 . The
architecture’s modular design means ChefsPlan could run instances on zkSync, Polygon, etc., while
keeping a unified cross-chain reputation via bridged soulbound tokens or oracles 31 . Off-chain agents
must also evolve – the Matching Agent, for example, should use more sophisticated algorithms
(potentially AI/ML-driven) to match thousands of chefs to gigs in real time 32 . The AI Copilot agent
could take a larger role in system oversight, optimizing postings, or detecting anomalies. Additionally,
performance enhancements like batched transactions, meta-transactions (gas abstractions), and
contract optimizations will be implemented to ensure the platform remains fast and cost-effective at
scale. Overall, Phase 3 is about ensuring ChefsPlan can grow from serving a pilot group to serving many
cities, with robust infrastructure.
Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Optimize smart contracts for gas and throughput – Review and refine the Solidity contracts to
handle higher load. This might include minimizing gas costs of frequent operations (e.g., using more
efficient data structures or caching values) – following known gas optimization techniques 33 .
Implement batch operations where possible (for instance, if a restaurant wants to post 10 shifts at once,
allow a batch posting function to save gas). Consider leveraging zkSync-specific features like native
account abstraction or meta-transactions to improve user experience (e.g., a gas relay contract so that
restaurants can pay gas fees on behalf of chefs) 33 .
- [ ] Horizontal scalability & multi-chain – Deploy ChefsPlan to additional networks if needed. For
example, launch the smart contracts on another zk-rollup or sidechain to serve users who prefer that
network (while zkSync remains primary). If doing so, create a strategy for cross-chain coordination:
ensure that reputation and identity are recognized across chains. One approach is deploying a unified
reputation oracle that aggregates data from all deployments and can issue a combined SBT or update a
global record 31 . Another approach: limit certain networks to certain regions to reduce cross-chain
interaction. Task: set up deployment scripts for new chain(s), adjust agent configurations to monitor
multiple networks, and implement a bridging or sync mechanism for reputational data (could be as
simple as a periodic export/import or a trust-minimized oracle feed of top-level stats).
- [ ] Scale out off-chain agents – Upgrade the architecture of the off-chain agents for reliability and
speed. This could involve running multiple instances of each agent type in a load-balanced way. For
example, multiple Matching Agents could each handle a subset of shifts (maybe partitioned by region
or by chef categories) and publish suggestions, with the best suggestion taken or combined. Introduce
more AI/ML: use machine learning to rank or recommend matches (e.g., train a model on past
successful gigs to predict good chef-restaurant matches). The AI Copilot agent can be enhanced to
manage agent coordination – e.g., monitoring if one Matching Agent is overwhelmed and spinning up
another, or analyzing system metrics to anticipate demand spikes 32 .
- [ ] Agent decentralization prep – While still running centrally, prepare to allow community
participation in running agents. This could include open-sourcing the agent code and designing a
protocol for how multiple agents might compete or collaborate. For instance, define a system where
multiple Matching Agents can submit recommendations for a shift, and perhaps the one that
consistently performs best could be rewarded. This is forward-looking to the DAO phase, but Phase 3
can pilot it in-house (run two different matching algorithms concurrently and compare outcomes, etc.).
Document how external parties might plug in an agent in the future, to smooth the transition.
- [ ] Performance and load testing – Conduct thorough scalability testing. Use scripts or simulation to
create a large number of transactions (e.g., simulate thousands of shifts and applications) on a testnet

12

or a zkSync local node 34 35 . Monitor the system’s response: identify bottlenecks (maybe the
Matching Agent CPU usage, or a spike in gas costs for a certain contract function). Tune parameters
accordingly – for example, if the Matching Agent is too slow, maybe reduce the frequency of its checks
or simplify its algorithm for large loads. Also test the user interface under load (can the frontend handle
showing hundreds of shifts without lag? Does the notifications system scale?).
- [ ] UX improvements for scale – As the platform grows, small UX issues can become big problems.
Revisit the UI design to incorporate better filtering, sorting, and management of a high volume of
content (e.g., a restaurant with 50 active shifts needs dashboard tools to manage them). Possibly
integrate real-time features (like websockets for instant updates when applications come in) to avoid
constant polling. Implement gas abstractions in UX: e.g., if using meta-transactions, allow a one-click
action for chefs that doesn’t prompt for gas (the gas could be taken care of by the system or sponsor).
Also consider multilingual support and other enhancements as user base diversifies.
Team Roles Involved:
- Blockchain Architect – Leads the multi-chain expansion strategy. Evaluates which networks to expand to
(based on user demand or cost benefits), designs the cross-chain reputation solution, and ensures
contract optimizations are safe and effective. Coordinates any additional deployments on new chains.
- DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer – Focuses on the deployment and monitoring infrastructure. In Phase 3,
this includes scaling the backend: setting up additional servers or cloud resources for multiple agent
instances, using container orchestration if needed (Docker/Kubernetes) to manage services, and
implementing robust monitoring (dashboard for agent health, alerts if an agent crashes or lags). Also
handles any nodes or oracles that facilitate cross-chain communication.
- AI/ML Specialist – If AI is introduced for matching or recommendations, an ML engineer will develop
and train models. They will need historical data (collected from Phase 1/2 usage) to train algorithms
that can, for example, predict no-shows or optimize match quality. They work on integrating these
models into the Matching Agent or a new “Recommendation Service.”
- Front-End Lead – Improves the front-end to handle scale. This involves optimizing code, maybe
implementing virtual scrolling for lists, ensuring that new data (like many notifications or messages)
doesn’t overwhelm the browser. Also leads UX adjustments to manage complexity (like better
dashboards for power users). Coordinates with the blockchain team to incorporate new features like
gas-less transactions (which might require UI changes to hide gas or explain sponsored transactions).
- Quality Assurance Engineer – In a scaled environment, QA must test under various scenarios. They
might use automated load testing tools or coordinate large group testing sessions. They also test on
multiple network configurations if multi-chain: e.g., scenario where a user has profiles on two chains –
does the UI aggregate that correctly? They ensure the system remains stable and user-friendly as
features are added.
Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- Historical Data & Analytics: Have sufficient usage data from earlier phases to inform scaling
decisions. For example, metrics like average transactions per user per day, peak usage times, or which
features are most used. This data can identify where optimizations are needed most and train AI
models. Set up analytics collection (if not already done) in earlier phases so that by Phase 3 there’s a
repository of info to work with.
- Multi-Chain Tooling: Research and select tools for cross-chain operations. This could include oracles
(Chainlink or custom solution) to relay information (like aggregated reputation scores) between chains,
and bridges if assets or data need to move. If launching an app-specific rollup via the zkSync Stack,
engage with Matter Labs early to plan that and ensure the team has the expertise to operate a rollup
(which is more complex than deploying to an existing chain).
- Computing Resources: Scaling agents and adding AI might require more computing power. Ensure
the budget for servers or cloud services is available. For instance, running an AI service might need a
machine with a GPU or at least substantial CPU if doing real-time inference. Plan for horizontal scaling:

13

maybe have the infrastructure as code (Terraform or similar) ready to spin up multiple instances behind
load balancers.
- Testing Environment: Maintain a robust staging environment that mirrors the scaled architecture.
This could mean having a mini-network of agents and maybe a dedicated test chain to simulate multichain. For example, deploy a copy of contracts to a Polygon testnet in addition to zkSync testnet, and
test the bridging of rep between them. The environment should allow the team to practice upgrades
and catch issues before they hit real users.
- Community Communication: As scaling often comes with changes (like potentially moving to
additional networks or introducing new agent behaviors), have a communication plan for the
community. This is not a strict technical dependency, but important for smooth roll-out: e.g., if enabling
meta-transactions, educate users that they can now do X without gas; if launching on a new chain,
guide interested users on how to access it. Possibly recruit power users to beta test new improvements
(like an improved matching algorithm) before full deployment.

Decentralized Governance & Token Model (Phase 4)
In the final phase, ChefsPlan will transition to a community-governed platform by introducing a
governance token and setting up a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The aim is to
empower users (chefs, restaurants, and other stakeholders) to have a say in the platform’s evolution,
aligning ChefsPlan with decentralized ethos not just in infrastructure but also in decision-making 36 .
The governance token (let’s call it $CHEF for now) would be distributed to participants, for example as
rewards for completing gigs, contributing to the ecosystem, or through a retroactive airdrop to early
adopters. Token holders can then use their $CHEF to vote on proposals – these could include changes to
platform fees, dispute resolution processes, new feature rollout, or electing a council of representatives.
The DAO could control key smart contract parameters (like escrow rules or treasury funds), and over
time even assume ownership of the upgradeable proxy admin roles, fully decentralizing control. An
initial treasury will be established (possibly funded by a portion of platform fees or an allocation of
tokens) to fund community-driven initiatives. Furthermore, previously off-chain services can be opened
up – for instance, community members could run their own Matching Agents and get rewarded by the
DAO for good performance 37 . Phase 4 thus involves not just technical steps (deploying token and
governance contracts) but also careful economic and community planning to ensure a successful
handover to the community.
Key Development Tasks:
- [ ] Design tokenomics – Define the total supply of the governance token, distribution mechanisms,
and utility. For example, decide what portion goes to the team/investors vs. community, how much is
allocated for user rewards, and if there’s a vesting schedule. Outline how users earn tokens: e.g., a
certain number of tokens per completed shift (perhaps weighted by transaction size or given equally to
chef and restaurant), or a reputation-linked reward. Ensure the design incentivizes positive actions
(good work, honest reviews) and doesn’t encourage abuse (for instance, guard against someone
gaming rewards by creating fake gigs). Consult industry models for reference (like other DAO-driven
marketplaces).
- [ ] Implement the token contract – Develop a smart contract for the governance token $CHEF. This
will likely be an ERC-20 token with additional features such as snapshots (useful for voting, so voting
power can be calculated at proposal block) or inflationary mechanisms if ongoing rewards are needed.
Consider using OpenZeppelin templates for ERC-20 and possibly extensions for governance. If planning
to use the token for fee payments or staking, ensure the contract supports those interactions. Conduct
a security audit on token contract given its importance.
- [ ] Deploy governance framework – Set up the DAO governance contracts. This could be a custom
setup or using known frameworks like OpenZeppelin Governor contracts, DAOstack, Compound’s
governance model, or Snapshot (off-chain voting with on-chain execution). A likely approach is

14

deploying a Governor contract where proposals are voted on by token holders and a Timelock contract
that, upon proposal passage, executes the changes (such as calling functions to change fees or upgrade
contracts). Also, consider a Treasury contract controlled by the DAO for managing funds. Task:
configure parameters like voting delay, voting period, quorum, and proposal thresholds in the
governance contract to suit the community size (initially, these might be low if community is small, and
can be raised as it grows). 36
- [ ] Integrate on-chain governance control – Gradually migrate control of key platform parameters to
the DAO. This involves identifying what decisions the DAO should have power over. Examples: set the
escrow fee percentage, choose to deploy on a new network, adjust reputation algorithm parameters, or
allocate treasury funds to marketing or insurance pools. Technically, this means certain functions in
contracts that were previously restricted to the admin or owner should now only be changeable via
governance proposals. For instance, if Escrow.sol had an owner who could set a fee, modify it so that
the owner is the DAO’s Timelock contract. Similarly, the upgradeable proxy admin could be transferred
to the DAO’s multisig or timelock, so upgrades become subject to votes. Plan a safe transition – possibly
start with less critical parameters and later hand off more control as the community proves capable.
- [ ] Community launch and airdrop – When the token and DAO are ready, execute a launch plan. This
could include an airdrop of tokens to early users (chefs and restaurants who used the platform in
Phases 1-3) to bootstrap governance with a diverse set of stakeholders. Also possibly allocate tokens to
those who contributed (e.g., testers, partners). Develop a distribution script and verify it carefully (you
may need to snapshot user activity up to a certain block and allocate tokens accordingly). Launch a web
interface for the DAO (maybe integrate with the existing dApp or use a platform like Snapshot for
proposal discussion). Provide educational materials so users know how to use their tokens to vote.
Possibly run a few “test” proposals (like non-critical votes) to get everyone comfortable with the process.
- [ ] Enable community-run agents and contributions – Open source the code for the off-chain agents
and provide guidelines for anyone to run them. The DAO can then decide to reward agent operators.
For example, the DAO might set aside some tokens to pay out monthly to the best performing Matching
Agent (as measured by, say, how quickly shifts get filled or user ratings of matches). Develop a
mechanism for this: it could be as informal as the community voting each month on agent
performance, or as automated as the agents themselves reporting metrics to a contract. Encourage
community developers to propose improvements (through governance proposals) to agent algorithms,
new features, or even protocol changes. Essentially, foster a developer community around ChefsPlan.
- [ ] Legal and security final checks – Before full decentralization, consult legal experts on the token
distribution and DAO setup to ensure compliance with securities and regulations (especially since
ChefsPlan deals with real work arrangements, there may be labor laws intersecting token incentives).
Implement any necessary safeguards (for example, maybe the DAO cannot change certain core rules
that keep the platform legally compliant, or if it does, there’s a failsafe). Once clear, proceed to transfer
any remaining admin keys to the DAO. At this point, announce that ChefsPlan is community-governed
and the core team is just a part of the community, not in sole control.
Team Roles Involved:
- Tokenomics Expert/Blockchain Dev – Designs the token and writes the smart contracts for token and
governance. Needs to understand both technical solidity implementation and economic implications.
Will work on simulations or models to predict how tokens will circulate and be used.
- Community Manager – Crucial at this phase, acts as the liaison between the core dev team and the user
community. Helps set up initial governance processes, moderates forums or Discord where proposals
are discussed, and educates users on how to participate. They may also organize events (AMA, tutorials)
around the token launch and DAO voting.
- Legal Advisor – Reviews the token model and DAO structure for compliance. Advises on whether the
token might be considered a security, how to minimize legal risks, and ensures that the DAO’s decisions
(especially around real-world work arrangements) won’t run afoul of laws. Possibly helps in drafting
terms of service updates to reflect the new decentralized ownership.

15

- Back-end/Full-Stack Developer – Extends the platform’s front-end to incorporate governance features.
This could involve adding a “Governance” section to the dApp where users can see proposals, vote (if
on-chain voting via web3) or be redirected to a Snapshot page. Also responsible for integrating any offchain snapshot votes with on-chain execution if that route is chosen.
- DevOps – Helps with the token distribution mechanics (running the scripts to distribute tokens to
possibly thousands of addresses, ensuring no hiccups). Also may set up any necessary off-chain
infrastructure for governance (like a Discourse forum for proposal discussions, or ensuring
snapshot.space is configured for the project).
- Core Team (All) – The existing core team should plan to gradually step back control but still be heavily
involved in guiding the community initially. They might seed the DAO with some example proposals (like
improvement proposals that were already planned) to show how it works. Each member might assume
more of an advisory role to the community rather than unilateral decision-maker.
Prerequisites & Dependencies:
- Legal Structure for DAO: Decide if the DAO will have any legal wrapper (some DAOs set up a
foundation or an LLC to represent them for contracts and legal interactions). If deemed necessary, set
this up with the help of legal counsel. If not, at least establish clear terms in the smart contracts and
documentation that outline the risk and responsibilities (DAO governance means the community
decisions are final, etc.).
- Treasury Funds: Accumulate some funds for the DAO treasury prior to launch. For example, the
platform might have collected fees during earlier phases (if any fees were enabled) – decide to transfer
those to the DAO. Or allocate a percentage of token supply as the treasury. This treasury gives the DAO
resources to fund proposals (like paying for further development, community initiatives, insurance
pools, etc.).
- Community Platforms: Ensure there are channels for community discussion and proposal ideation.
This may involve setting up a forum (like forum.chefsplan.com), a Discord/Telegram specifically for
governance talk, and encouraging migration of conversations from private channels to public ones.
Also, possibly deploy a voting interface: if using on-chain voting via Governor contract, something like
Tally or Sybil can be used; if using off-chain Snapshot for signaling, configure that.
- Snapshot of Participation: Prepare the data needed for token distribution. For fairness, you’d likely
consider metrics like number of shifts completed, total volume, reputation, etc., to distribute tokens.
This data should be extracted from contract events or databases. Verify its accuracy and perhaps have it
reviewed by an objective party or at least multiple team members to avoid mistakes in who gets what.
- Security Audits: The new governance contracts and token contracts should be audited. Also, consider
auditing the whole system now from a perspective of how it all ties together (a holistic audit) since it’s
the final stage – especially because you’re about to hand off control. Any vulnerabilities left could be
catastrophic once control is decentralized (since no central kill-switch). So, get a thorough security
review of the entire ChefsPlan 5.0 stack if possible.
- Operational Transition: Internally, the team should prepare for a different role. This includes possibly
revoking deployer privileges, handing server control to community (if going fully decentralized on
agents, else at least being transparent about agent operation). Draft a “Declaration of Decentralization”
document that outlines which parts of the system are now community-controlled and which (if any)
remain with the team. This transparency will help build trust that Phase 4 is complete and not
superficial.
Throughout these phases, it’s important to iterate and incorporate feedback. By following this roadmap,
ChefsPlan 5.0 will gradually evolve from a team-driven MVP into a fully decentralized, communitygoverned ecosystem – delivering on the vision of a trustless gig-work platform for hospitality 38 37 .
Each phase builds on the last, adding functionality, security, and decentralization, while the provided
checklists ensure that the development team covers all necessary tasks, roles, and preparations at every

16

step. With this plan, ChefsPlan can systematically grow into a scalable, privacy-preserving, and selfsustaining network for chefs and restaurants worldwide.
